1. Open config.ini.php and set an environment.
   For example if you want to run JAXL with your local jabber server (e.g. ejabberd) set $env = "devel"
   If you are running JAXL with Gtalk set $env = "prod"

2. Update $key array with your development and production username and passwords.
   For example your $key array must look something like this
   $key = array("prod"=>array("user"=>"myGmailUsername",
                              "pass"=>"myGmailPassword",
                              "host"=>"talk.google.com",
                              "port"=>5222,
                              "domain"=>"gmail.com"
                             ),
               "devel"=>array("user"=>"admin",
                              "pass"=>"adminPassword",
                              "host"=>"localhost",
                              "port"=>5222,
                              "domain"=>"localhost"
                             )
               );

3. If you want to log incoming messages and statuses in MySQL, set $logDB = TRUE

4. Update $db array with your MySQL connection settings.
   For example your $key must look like:
   $db = array("prod"=>array("dbuser"=>"root",
                             "dbpass"=>"password",
                             "dbhost"=>"localhost",
                             "dbname"=>"jaxl"
                            ),
              "devel"=>array("dbuser"=>"root",
                             "dbpass"=>"password",
                             "dbhost"=>"localhost",
                             "dbname"=>"jaxl"
                            )
              );

5. Customize eventMessage() and eventPresence() methods in jaxl.class.php to suit your application needs.
   By default eventMessage() sends back a message "Hi, Thanks for your message" for every message received.

6. Open a command line and migrate to the folder.
   Run: php index.php 
   from command line and monitor the logs under /logs folder
